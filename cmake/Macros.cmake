#This file contains macros that are useful for taking care of boilerplate in

#situation.

# Wraps the boilerplate for starting Hunter.  Must be a macro and not a function
# because Hunter introduces some variables it needs into the global namespace.
# To force Hunter to use a hunter/Config.cmake file for your project add "LOCAL"
# to the end of the HunterGate command.
