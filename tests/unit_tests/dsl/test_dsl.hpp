/* Testing strategy.
 *
 * The DSL component doesn't really care what the types are as long as they
 * are comparable via operator==. So we test with built-in types:
 *
 * - double
 * - int
 *
 * and "user-defined" (actually defined in standard library) types like:
 *
 * - std::vector<int>
 * - std::map<double, int>.
 *
 * For the purposes of integration testing, the tests in operator_impl.cpp
 * will ensure that operators can be added together.
